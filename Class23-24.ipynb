For example, in the above program `y` has the value `0.3333333333333333` which is an approximation of `1/3` to 16 decimal places, but it is not exactly one third.  Thus, operations on `1/3` do not behave exactly like we might naturally expect.  Why exactly this happens is a topic for a later course.  However, practically we will often have to deal with this type of approximation in our programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result you observed in __Q25__ is often referred to as rounding error. This type of error can occur anytime we use `float` values and thus it is a good idea to not compare floats exactly as we did above.  Instead, it is best to check if two `float` values are _close enough_.  [Section 7.5 from the text](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2008.html#sec86) gives an example of how to do such a check.  \n",

    "We now have two mechanisms in Python for repeating statements. We know from earlier questions that a `while` loop can accomplish anything that a simple `for` loop can accomplish. However, the simple `for` loop is better suited to situations where we know how many times we want to repeat the *loop body*.  While a `while` loop is better suited to situations in which we want to repeat the statements *while* some condition is true, or until some condition holds. Thus, choosing to use a simple `for` or a `while` communicates something to the human reader as well. \n",
